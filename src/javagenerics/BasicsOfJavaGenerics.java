/*
   Java Generics is a powerful feature introduced in Java 5 to provide compile-time type
   safety and to enable programmers to write generic code that works with different types.
    It allows classes, interfaces, and methods to be parameterized with types.
     Syntax:
    Generics are represented using angle brackets '<' and '>'.
     The generic type parameter is specified within these angle brackets.
